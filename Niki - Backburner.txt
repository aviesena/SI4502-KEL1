I can't lie, it feels nice that you're calling
And for once I don't care about what you want
As long as we keep talking (as long as we're talking)
You sound sad and alone, and you're stalling
I mean, you gotta admit the history's kind of unmatched
Asian Calvinism, we made it out of that


Inggit Yeira Budi Agranata.


Rachmawati
Well, whether we're free of will or predestined
Clearly, I've not learned my lesson even now
Hope He doesn't strike me down (strike me down)
The Goo-Goo Dolls are dead to me
The way you should bะต, too
But you bring them up
Along with how much I f- miss you
